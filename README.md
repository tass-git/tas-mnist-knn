This is an ML model trained with k-nearest-neighbor to classify handwritten numbers. 
Dataset: sklearn.datasets openml mnist 784
Data structure:  70000 images 28x28 pixels in black & white of numbers between 0 and 9.
Evaluation Metric: error

Objectif:Observe the diffrence made by using best k for the algorithm( decreased error range)
